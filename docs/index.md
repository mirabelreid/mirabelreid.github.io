<h3>Experience</h3>
<h4>Graduate Research</h4>
<p>My doctoral research has focused on analyzing iterative processes over random graphs. My primary focus has been studying the k-cap process, defined as follows. Given a random graph G, the ùëò-cap process is defined as follows. At each time step ùë°, there is a set ùê¥ùë° consisting of ùëò vertices of G, where ùëò is a fixed parameter of the process. This set fires, delivering a signal to its neighbors. At the next time step, ùë°+1, the ùëò vertices with the highest degree from ùê¥ùë° fire. This simple process has complex underlying behavior. It also has applications to the study of the behavior of firing neurons in the brain.</p>

<p>Given an initial firing set, a natural question to ask is how the structure of the firing set evolves over time. This question depends heavily on the structure of the graph. I studied the convergence of this process on geometric random graphs, focusing on a graph structure that had dense local subgraphs. In a geometric random graph, the probability of an edge is a function of the distance between its endpoints in a hidden variable space. Because this distance can represent physical space, this type of graph is often used to model physical transportation networks. It has been studied as a model for networks of neurons in the brain. The paper is available <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v195/reid23a/reid23a.pdf">here</a>.

<p> In Summer 2023, I interned at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems with Dr. Samira Samadi on online algorithms for learning to defer to human experts. We devised a contextual bandit model of this setting and leveraged the relevant literature to build an efficient algorithm with strong guarantees.</p>
 <p> In Summer 2022, I was an intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I researched the machine learning workflow in the sciences. Building ML models in the natural sciences requires a different outlook, often with a heavier focus on data exploration. Despite this, most of the literature on the ML workflow focuses solely on industry applications. I investigated this disparity and built a metadata visualization platform to meet the data exploration needs of a group at Los Alamos.</p>

<h4>Undergraduate</h4>
<p> I interned at the Software Engineering Institute from January-August 2020. I worked with the Emerging Technology Center and the Software Solutions Division, and researched novel applications of Graph Neural Networks to software development.</p>
<p> I participated in the Civic Data Science REU at Georgia Tech in Summer 2019. I worked under Dr. Omar Asensio to help analyze the impact of federal housing policy in Albany, GA. 
<p> From January 2017-January 2020, I worked as a research assistant at the Geomorphology Lab at the University of Pittsburgh under Dr. Eitan Shelef. I studied a mathematical model for common properties of natural transportation networks.</p>
